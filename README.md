# Commute_Swap
CommuteSwap is a web app for job seekers who are looking for shorter commutes- or looking to swap jobs with a similarly employed job seeker in another city. Users can find others of the same profession and work experience plotted on a Google Map, and if they believe each other to be a match, they can communicate via a messaging feature.
